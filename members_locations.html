<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Shilo_Village_(location)">Shilo Village</a></h3>
<p class="ind">Being only 10 tiles apart, this is the closest bank to furnace in the whole game. Unfortunately, it requires completion of Shilo Village quest, which is a moderately lengthed intermediate difficulty quest. You must also pay 20 coins each time you use the furnace, unless you complete the Elite Karamja Diary.</p>
<p class="ind">Because of the downsides of this location, it is strongly advised against.</p>
<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Prifddinas">Prifddinas</a></h3>
<p class="ind">Being only 11 tiles apart, and also being the closest furnace to an anvil, this spot is widely thought as the true best.</p>
<p class="ind">Unfortunately for beginners, it requires completion of the Song of the Elves quest, because of its location. This quest has very high requirements to begin and is considered a Very Long Grandmaster quest.</p>
<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Edgeville">Edgeville</a></h3>
<p class="ind">Being 14 tiles apart, it is not too bad compared to the above two, however it has no requirements to get to nor to use, and is directly next to the Grand Exchange.</p>
<p class="ind">This is actually also the closest possible bank to furnace available to Free-to-Play players.</p>
<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Neitiznot">Neitiznot</a></h3>
<p class="ind">Being 15 tiles apart, its not too bad of a spot, however it shines in how the bank and furnace are positioned, allowing you to bank and furnace without having to move your camera, thus being especially convenient for mobile players.</p>
<p class="ind">In order to get here, you must complete The Fremennik Trials quest and must also begin The Fremennik Isles quest.</p>
<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mount_Karuulm">Mount Karuulm</a></h3>
<p class="ind">Being 15 tiles apart, its not too bad of a spot, it's upside is its proximity to a fairy ring, allowing for quick teleport in and out of the location if you have them unlocked. The fairy ring code is CIR.</p>
