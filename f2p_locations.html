<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Edgeville">Edgeville</a></h3>
<p class="ind">The closest possible bank to furnace available to Free-to-Play players, it is actually also the third closest in the whole game at 14 tiles difference, and since it has no requirements to get to and use, and is directly next to the Grand Exchange, even many members will be crafting here.</p>
<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Al_Kharid">Al Kharid</a></h3>
<p class="ind">At 30 tiles, being the second closest available to Free-to-Play players at over double the distance, it is not worth going to.</p>
<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Falador">Falador</a></h3>
<p class="ind">At 40 tiles, being the third closest, it is really not advised to go here. If you do, the furnace is closer to the west bank.</p>
<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Lumbridge">Lumbridge</a></h3>
<p class="ind">At 85 tiles, its only use is because new players start in Lumbridge.</p>
<h3><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wilderness">The Wilderness</a></h3>
<p class="ind">Located 116 tiles from the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ferox_Enclave">Ferox Enclave</a> bank, in Level 28 Wilderness, its only use is because it is located near some wilderness mines, not at all for crafting jewelry.</p>
<p class="ind">It must be remembered that in the Wilderness, Player versus Player combat is always enabled, and anyone can kill you freely.</p>
