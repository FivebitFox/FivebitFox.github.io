<p class="ind">In order to craft jewelry you will need one gem, one bar, and the mould of the jewelry you are crafing. With this in your inventory, you will then go to a furnace, and click the jewelry you plan to make. Ideal places have banks near furnaces, in order to drop off finished jewelry and pick up raw materials quickly.</p>
